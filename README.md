## Installation

To compile all programs, open directory with program and write the next code in your bash:

```bash
make
```
If you want to compile only main program, type:
```bash

```
If you want to compile particular part of the first three programs use the construction similar to the next (example for 2_assign):
```bash
make 2
```
